        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-2">Welcome to learning about Python 3 Syntax! Here you will be learning about how to print phrases and sentences, inputting user data, creating variables, identifying basic errors, commenting, and arithmetic!<br>
        </p>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-3">Print Statements</h4>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-4">Let's Start with how to print sentences an example on how to do it is shown below:<br>
          <br>print("Hello World!")<br>This should then print out:<br>Hello World!<br>
          <br>As long as you have print("any words you want") you can print anything you desire! You can also combine print statements and user input. We will expand upon inputting data in a bit.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>print(input("Enter input: " ))<br>Output:<br>Enter input: Hello!<br>Hello!<br>
          <br>Also if you want spaces make sure to put that also in between the quotes. If you wish to print anything that isn't a string (not in "" or ''), like numbers, you must use the string command. It basically changes the number into a string variable. We will expand on the string variable later. However sometimes it does it automatically for you and you don't have to use the str command. Also to add statements not in quotes to a print statement you must use the + sign.<br>
          <br>Ex. print("My favorite number is " +&nbsp; str(5))<br>Output:<br>My favorite number is 5<br>
          <br>Now you try printing out in <a href="How-To-Install-Python-3.html" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">python 3</a>! The link will take you to our how to download Idle Python 3, so you can try doing all the examples in there!&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-5">Input User Data</h4>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-6">Input User Data</h4>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-7">Now that we have print statements down, let's learn to input user data! We already learned how to use input in print statements:<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>print(input("Enter input: " ))<br>Output:<br>Enter input: Hello!<br>Hello!<br>
          <br>Once you are running your code the input command will allow you to type in the output area. With the example above it will print out anything you type. You can also use user input as a variable:<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>userinput = input()<br>print(userinput)<br>
          <br>That is how you create a variable that will hold user input in string form. The userinput is the name of said variable and we then print the variable. You can also just set the variable to have text that tells you to input data like we did three examples above, but instead of printing it just putting it in a variable.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>userinput = input("Enter user input: ")<br>print(userinput)<br>
          <br>Now you try copying the examples done above! You can make your input be anything you want though! Here is a link to the page to install <a href="How-To-Install-Python-3.html" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">python 3</a>, for the input command cannot be used on here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-8">Variables</h4>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-9">We used our first variable in input user data, but now we will be expanding on that. The first variable we will be talking about we have already mentioned on the print statement page, and that is string variable. An example of one is below<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>Astring = "hello!"<br>
          <br>Now the variable Astring holds the word hello! Since it is already a string you do not need to use the str command to print it out in print statements. Also all variables are defined by creating a name then having it equal something and that will determine the variables type for in the example below:<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>numbers = 5<br>floats = 5.0<br>booleans = True<br>
          <br>The variable numbers holds the value 5 and is thus an integer. The variables floats holds 5.0 and is a float (a float variable is just numbers but with decimal points), and the variable booleans holds the value True and is a boolean variable. Booleans can only hold the value True and False, and True and False must always be uppercase when assigning them. You can also do multiple assignments at once.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>a = b = c = 1<br>ints, flo, bool = 5, 10.0, False<br>
          <br>The variables a, b, and c all equal 1, and variables ints equal 5, flo equal 10.0, and bool equal False. Also if you are ever unsure while coding of the variables and their types, there is a type command that will show you the variables type.<br>
          <br>Ex.&nbsp;<br>numbers = 7<br>print(type(numbers))<br>Output:<br>&lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
          <br>The output above tells that the type of variable numbers is, is an int variable. You can also assign variables to be different types of variables with the int, str, float, and bool command. Here is an example below:<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>flo = 4.3<br>ints = 6<br>bools = "True"<br>
          <br>print(int(flo))<br>print(float(ints))<br>print(boolean(bools))<br>print(str(ints))<br>Output:<br>4<br>6.0<br>True&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (as a boolean)<br>6<br>
          <br>What has happened is that flo turned into an int and rounded to the nearest whole number, ints was printed into a float and added a decimal, the string bools turned into the boolean with the value of True, and ints was turned into a string 6.<br>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-10">Arithmetic and MATH</h4>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-11">Hooray! Variables are done! But in this section you will learn how to do mathematics with integer and float variables and the rules. You will also learn to import the MATH class which allows you to do more mathematics that are not available on your keyboard (power, squared root, absolute value, etc).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Let's go over the basic of mathematic keys you can use for variables, floats, and numbers in general. You can use the + key to add, - key to subtract, * to multiply, and / to divide. All other types of equations require the class MATH, which we will explain in a bit. Here are some examples of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division below.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>x = 5<br>y = 3<br>z = 4<br>print(3/2)<br>print(x*y)<br>print(y+z)<br>print(x-z)<br>
          <br>Output:<br>1<br>15<br>7<br>1<br>
          <br>When dividing integers the result will drop the remainder, if you want to keep the remainder you must cast the equation to a float.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>print(float(3/2))<br>
          <br>Output:<br>1.5<br>
          <br>There is also the modulo symbol %. Using this will divide two numbers then give you the remainder as the answer. So 1 % 2 would give me 1, for 2 goes into 1 0 times with a remainder of 1. It isn't used often, but it is used sometimes so don't forget it!<br>
          <br>Next you will learn how to import the MATH class. Sometimes you will have to import classes to use different methods. The MATH class will give you the ability to use math equations not on your keyboard. We will not go over all of them, but we will go over the ones you will use the most.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>import math<br>x = 3<br>y = 2<br>print(factorial(x))<br>print(pow(x, y))<br>print(sqrt(16))<br>print(abs(-10))<br>
          <br>Output:<br>6<br>9<br>4<br>10<br>
          <br>These are the most basic math equations that can be used, but there are many more. The factorial method gave the factorial of 3, which equals 6. The pow method took the power of y to x, which is the power of 2 to 3, which is 9. The sqrt takes the square root of a number, and the abs method gives the absolute value of a number.<br>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-12">Basic Errors and Commenting</h4>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-13">When writing code you will always run into errors. There are many type of errors, but I will go over the most basic ones so you can recognize them and fix the problem in your code. There is also commenting which helps organize your code, but we'll start with errors first.<br>
          <br>One of the most common errors is syntax errors, which is basically when you incorrectly place a character and the code is there unable to execute.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>print("Hello World"<br>
          <br>The example above is missing the ) to the print statement and will throw a syntax error.<br>
          <br>The next common is logic errors, and this can go in hand with arithmetic errors. An example is when there is no correct answer, and in math no real answer is common.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>print(5/0)<br>
          <br>This would run a logic/arithmetic error.<br>
          <br>Next is a runtime error, and this happens while the program is running after being succesfully started/compiled. An example is dividing a number by 0 as well for it compiles the code, but doesn;t understand the dividing by 0.<br>
          <br>Now that you have learned the 3 most basic errors, let's move on to commenting. Commentating helps you organize your code and there are two types. It's also very good for testing and commenting code out so it doesn't run, but not deleting it either. You can comment using # or """.<br>
          <br>Ex.<br>#This is a print statement<br>print("Hi!")<br>
          <br>"""x = 5<br>print(x)"""<br>
          <br>Using """ is good for comments longer than one line or commenting out code. # is used to basically define some of your code and organize it so you understand it.<br>
          <br>You can try commenting in your<a href="How-To-Install-Python-3.html" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3"> Idle Python!</a>
